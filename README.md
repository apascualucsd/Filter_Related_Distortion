# Filter_Related_Distortion
In this project we are going to form 500 symbols of a QPSK modulated communication signal with a sqrt-Nyquist shaping filter, a signal distorting band limiting low pass filter and a sqrt-Nyquist matched filter. Our goal is to compare the distortion levels induced by the low-pass filter and identify the filter with the minimum distortion.
